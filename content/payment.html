# Making Payments
I accept payments online and by check. My preferred method is through Dwolla.

## Online
Please make online payments through [**Dwolla**](http://refer.dwolla.com/a/clk/4xNctN). It's easier and cheaper than using PayPal, and it goes directly from your bank to my bank, without supporting any credit card companies.

To get rolling, simply:

1. [**Create an account at Dwolla**](http://refer.dwolla.com/a/clk/4xNctN)
2. **Link your bank account** to Dwolla (verification takes a few days, so don't fret on my behalf! I'm 100% content to wait until it goes through). Instructions are on the [top half of this page](http://help.dwolla.com/customer/portal/articles/235882-how-can-i-add-funds-into-my-dwolla-account-video-).
3. [**Send your payment**](https://www.dwolla.com/hub/jeremyblanchardcoaching)

## By Check
If Dwolla doesn't work for you, please mail me a check.
