Hi, friend! I'm **Jeremy**.

I want to change the world.

I want to do that by supporting the people who are making change.

Have you experienced taking a step back from going for a goal that really speaks to your heart?
Like leaving your day job to make money in a way that makes a bigger difference in the world?

Life coaching is a set of tools that can help you go past the point where you often stop yourself.
As a coach, I support you in becoming clear on what is most important to you, often when there are competing priorities.
And once your priorities are clear, we'll work together to transform your goals from visions into reality.

Are you interested in learning a bit more about coaching and how it might be supportive in your situation?
If so, email me saying "Hi!" at <a href="mailto:coach@blanchardjeremy.com?subject=Coaching Interest!&body=Hi there! I'd love to chat more about coaching!">coach@blanchardjeremy.com</a>.
